# Egghead NodeJS & IBM Domino Integration Course
## Lesson 2 - Login to Domino via NodeJS

You must do a npm install after switching to this branch.

An example login form will be served from the public folder via the NodeJS server.

This example HTML file references some external libraries via a CDN (Bootstrap, fontawesome, axios) 

You will need to modify the login URL to your Domino Server and then use your credentials for checking the log in code.
This URL is in the server.js file.
