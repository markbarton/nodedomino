# Egghead NodeJS & IBM Domino Integration Course
## Lesson 11 - Render Domino Data using Handlebars templates in Express

For this lesson you should give anonymous reader access in the ACL of the test database.
If when testing you do not get any data displayed its possibly because you havent updated the ACL.

You must do a npm install after switching to this branch.

You will need to change the handlebars template (demo) to repoint the URL for the example images to your Domino Server.

The example database is in lesson 1 if required.
