Example code to go with the Egghead videos on Domino and NodeJS intergration

Each lesson in the Egghead course is associated with a different branch.

Just change the branch to the associated lesson to see the final code for that lesson

The example Notes Database is attached to the repo under the lesson 1 branch.

Change the ACL before copying to your Domino server and signing the database - make yourself a manager and set default = No Access and anonymous = No Access. Other lessons may change Anonymous to reader.

You must have a recent installation of NodeJS and you must do a NPM install after you have clone this repo and after each branch change.
