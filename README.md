You must do a npm install after switching to this branch.

An example form will be served from the public folder via the NodeJS server.  For this lesson it is called swrecords.html

This example HTML file references some external libraries via a CDN (Bootstrap, fontawesome, axios)

You will need to modify the login URL and Get Domino Data to your Domino Server and then use your credentials when logging in. These URLs are in the server.js file.
