# Egghead NodeJS & IBM Domino Integration Course
## Lesson 10 - Update and delete data in Domino via NodeJS

For this lesson you should remove the ability for you to delete from the ACL of the demo database.

You must do a npm install after switching to this branch.

An example form will be served from the public folder via the NodeJS server.  For this lesson it is called swrecords.html

This example HTML file references some external libraries via a CDN (Bootstrap, fontawesome, axios)

You will need to modify the login URL and Get Domino Data to your Domino Server and then use your credentials when logging in. These URLs are in the server.js file.

The example database is in lesson 1 if required.
